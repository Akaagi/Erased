# Erased
Unity Game - Project S2 for EPITA

Erased is a Unity-based game that follows the conventions of a Metroidvania. It draws inspiration from several iconic 2D action-adventure and platformer games, including Hollow Knight, The Binding of Isaac, and Celeste.

# Game Modes

## Solo Mode

In Solo Mode, the player must complete multiple chapters to progress through the story. This involves exploring the world and battling various monsters, entities, and bosses in each level using the weapons and powers acquired along the way.

## Multiplayer Mode

Our Multiplayer Mode pits 2 to 4 players against each other in a competitive match. Once all players are gathered on the central platform, they can battle to collect the most coins within a 3-minute and 45-second time limit. The arena offers two weapons— a sword and a bow—along with a dash ability. Each death incurs a penalty of two points, while each kill awards a bonus of three points. At the end of the match, the player with the most stars wins the game.
